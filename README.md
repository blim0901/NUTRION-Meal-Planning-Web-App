# NUTRION-Meal-Planning-Web-App
For this project, the aim was to develop an application to allow people to live smarter, changing the way people live and learn. With our tool, it empowers people to live a healthier life by making the process of food planning much easier.

NUTRION is a self-contained web-based application which aims to aid health enthusiasts and individuals with strict dietary restrictions in pursuing a healthier lifestyle. By providing and integrating information about healthy foods that are categorized based on keywords such as nutrients and ingredients, users of NUTRION will be able to explore the foods they need in order to achieve a healthier diet. Other than that, by using a weekly meal plan planner, users of NUTRION will be able to oversee their weekly diet goals and easily plan meals that would otherwise take hours if you were using traditional means like an excel file.  Information such as the description of weekly meal plans, dishes and their respective price will be made available to provide an informative platform for our users.

NUTRION operates using the Django framework for backend web-development, and also React.js for frontend web-development.
